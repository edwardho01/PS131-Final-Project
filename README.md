# PS131-Final-Project

My project will outline predictor variables of interest that could potentially predict the severity of a car accident. Using logistic regression, single
decision trees, random forest, boosted tree, and k-nearest neighbors, I'll perform categorical predictive analysis to potentially prediction the binary classification
of an accidents severity of 2 or 4.
